Our Project is called GenGacha. It is a Genshin Impact Gacha Simulator for loyal fans to capture their favourite characters and weapons. Through this Gacha Simulator, players can immerse themselves in an amazing experience by rolling the gacha and obtaining different weapons and heroes. They are also capable of storing their progress by creating an account. Furthermore, for competitive players, there is a leaderboard players can try to be in. The GenGacha is also embedded with sleek and modern animations from Lottie Animation in order to give players the best user experience when using GenGacha.
## Design Process
We planned this GenGacha to be catered for players who love the game Genshin Impact as the characters and weapons in GenGacha is from Genshin Impact. We want them to feel like they are playing a draft, with a chance to obtain good characters or bad characters. That time of anticipation and excitement is what we were looking for.

- As a user type, I want to be able to create an account , so that I can store my items in the inventory.

- As a user type, I want to be able to see the odds of obtaining a 5 star item, so that I can see how much rolls I need to do to obtain a character I want.

- As a user type, I want to be able to see items that I have pulled, so that I can count how many 5 star items I have obtained.
