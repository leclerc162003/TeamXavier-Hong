Our Project is called GenGacha. It is a Genshin Impact Gacha Simulator for loyal fans to capture their favourite characters and weapons. Through this Gacha Simulator, players can immerse themselves in an amazing experience by rolling the gacha and obtaining different weapons and heroes. They are also capable of storing their progress by creating an account. Furthermore, for competitive players, there is a leaderboard players can try to be in. The GenGacha is also embedded with sleek and modern animations from Lottie Animation in order to give players the best user experience when using GenGacha.
